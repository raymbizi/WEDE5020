<h1>Here at teraystudios we strongly believe in this Sustainability Tip:</h1>
<p>Thrifting keeps clothing out of landfills and reduces demand for fast fashion. Every time you thrift, 
you're voting for the planet.</p>
<p> A study by planet calls How Thrifting Can Help Us Save the Planet
Did you know that clothing production accounts for 20 to <highlight>35%</highlight35> of microplastic flows into the ocean and outweighs the carbon footprint of international flights and shopping combined? Unfortunately, we seem to underestimate the environmental impact of this industry. At the same time, the rate of manufacturing will continue to grow. Since the 1980s, fashion behaviour has leaned toward increased consumption. People used to buy few things with a long shelf life. 
Now, under the influence of short-term trends, people buy lots of new clothes that they are likely to discard either because the items become worn out or they are no longer trendy. </p>
