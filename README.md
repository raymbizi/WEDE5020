This repository will store my business website 
Adding CSS my website
**Review of PART 1**
I did very well in some areas of my project. My proposed website functions were comprehensive and detailed, and my technical requirements were clearly defined. I also submitted two proposals with complete content, and my file and folder structure was well organised and logical. I performed well but can still improve in other areas. My design aesthetic was vague and lacked coherence, and my wireframes were incomplete. My project timeline was considered vague, and my budget was clear but not fully detailed. My sitemap was complete but could have been more detailed.
In terms of content research, my work was relevant and mostly complete, but there were still areas where I could have added more depth. With HTML structure, my layout and tags were mostly correct, but I made minor inconsistencies that affected accuracy and organisation. Overall, I showed strength in planning, technical structure, and functionality, but I need to improve the clarity and detail of my design elements, budget, and research content while also fixing small HTML errors.
